# MemChat

If you clone this repo and run `npm start`, this website will appear at `localhost:3000`.

You will be able to log in and authenticate using Google, and you can search for other users on the platform and message them.

The API for the chat summarization model is down currently, but you can still use the chat service without it. If you press the "Remind Me" button, nothing will happen.
